Two American companies, Indian and Harley-Davidson, dominated the market in the U.S. until the waves of British and Japanese imports in the 1950s and 1960s offered consumers more choices, especially when it came to smaller bikes. Indian sputtered until its rebirth in 2006, while Harley-Davidson roared back to life in the 1980s after a disastrous decade under the management of AMF. Today, vintage "hogs" by both manufacturers are favorites of riders and collectors alike.
