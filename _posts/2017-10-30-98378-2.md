Without a change, Toys “R” Us could fall to the history books with brands like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahsweeney/2011/07/26/borders-a-retrospective/#bea0e9363210" target="_self">Borders</a>, the national bookseller that couldn’t compete with Amazon. They could be yet another company to disappear from the national landscape. Riding off into the sunset doesn’t need to be the reality for Toys “R” Us. If leaders within the company want to lead a great comeback story, then it’s time to engage millennials.
