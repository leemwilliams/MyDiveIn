<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am sure that you have heard by now that it's Black History Month. It’s a month where we reflect on the legacy of great Black historical figures. Yet the history of the founder of Black History Month remains shrouded in mystery. Who was he?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">His name is Carter Godwin Woodson, </span><a href="https://www.biography.com/people/carter-g-woodson-9536515"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a black Historian in the 1920’s and 1930’s.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He was the second black student to obtain a PhD from the University of Chicago after <a href="http://www.naacp.org/oldest-and-boldest/naacp-history-w-e-b-dubois/">W.E.B. DuBois</a>, a contemporary of his. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An ardent traveler, Woodson was able to observe the realized potential of black students abroad in the Philippines and Europe. He soon noticed the United States set a disturbing precedent for conditioning the black student with a sense of passivity and inferiority. He believed the education system's failure to teach authentic Black history in schools and the scarcity of literature on this history was unacceptable. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were four themes in U.S. History that troubled Woodson</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The conditioning of the black individual to sublimate themselves into the “proper place”</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The didactic nature of white teachers who had authority over black students</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of Black teachers, historic role models, and expression of Black realized potential</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of positive representations of Black culture</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Woodson set out to reverse these negative institutional systems. In 1933, he published his book “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mis-Education-Negro-Carter-Godwin-Woodson/dp/1680920685"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mis-Education of the Negro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” This book, which analyzes the forces that worked to keep African-Americans in their place, argued for a society in which the black individual worked against the negative education and conditioned themselves for resistance. </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Black History Month was not a product of a national whim, but of a lifetime of work to present a more </span>holistic<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and authentic history to empower the Black community. Now, more than ever, we need to educate ourselves on this history and understand how the fight goes on.    </span>
