<h2>Women Role Models Are Transcendent</h2>
By Sara Grimes

<span style="font-weight: 400">When Hidden Figures came out earlier this year, I had my doubts.  What could a sanitized PG movie possibly offer about the messy nuances facing women scientists back before #STEM education was #trending?  As it turns out, a lot.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The movie traces the journey of Katherine Johnson who works as a human computer, using analytical geometry to check the calculations of NASA’s Project Mercury as the first black woman on the Space Task Team. The shrill injustice of racism is felt viscerally from the indignity of having to drink from a segregated coffee pot to having the bigoted person who tried to segregate her from the team receive the credit for her work.  Yet Katherine Johnson uses her tenacity in the face of human cruelty and mathematical savvy to earn powerful allies and carve out a place for herself on the NASA team by leading the safe landing of Friendship 7, John Glenn’s orbit around the Earth.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The resonant beauty of stories like Hidden Figures, is that they are powerful enough to change minds, hearts.  Why?  Because of the power of multiple stories.  We have always been told a single story about John Glenn being the first American man to orbit Earth. That story had the power to shape young hearts to aspire to go to space for decades and stuck in the collective psyche as a rare moment in human history that was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">transcendent.  </span></i>

<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet when we simply tell one story </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">about John Glenn as the first American man to orbit Earth, we rob ourselves of so many other stories of transcendence.  The story of Katherine Johnson is the story of a black woman who paved the way for many other black women scientists to follow in her footsteps.  Yet until now, it hasn’t been a story we’ve told our youth.  Children need more diverse scientific role models that shatter boundaries and break ground, that can inspire them to question stereotypes and rise above society’s injustices.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Already, we are seeing the results of empowered women and girls. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">70% of the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-women-leading-the-march-for-science-prove-the-future-under-trump-is-female-52667">March for Science’s organizing</a> committee was comprised of women. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">We can no longer afford to settle for the same pop cultural, cinematic, and social tropes about  boys being more scientifically inclined than girls.  Black women don’t just need access to #STEM to “prove themselves.”  They are already rising above the hurdles of bigotry in science roles everyday.  What we need to do is circulate THEIR stories and allow THEIR narratives to shine forth and inspire us.  A single narrative about success is dangerous, but more importantly, diverse narratives are transcendent: they have the power to change our culture.</span>
